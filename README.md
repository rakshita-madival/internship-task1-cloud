Internship Task-01 — Cloud Storage Setup (AWS S3)

This task was completed as part of my Cloud Computing Internship to get hands-on with cloud object storage using Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).
The goal was to create a storage bucket, upload example files, and configure secure access permissions.

🧾 Objectives

✔ Create a cloud storage bucket
✔ Upload a sample file
✔ Configure access permissions
✔ Verify access functionality

🛠️ Tools & Services Used

AWS S3

IAM User

S3 Pre-Signed URLs

AWS Management Console

🪜 Steps Completed

Created a new S3 bucket named:
cloud-computing-internship-task1
in the ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region

Uploaded a sample file (photo.jpg) into the bucket to test storage

Configured secure access using a Pre-Signed URL instead of enabling public bucket access

Verified that the Pre-Signed URL worked successfully while keeping the bucket private

Captured screenshots as proof of completion and stored them in this repository

🔐 Security & Best Practices

✔ Bucket remained private throughout
✔ Pre-Signed URL used for temporary access
✔ No public exposure of objects
✔ IAM user access used (not root)
✔ Followed real cloud support behavior
⭐ Task Outcome

✔ Bucket created successfully
✔ Files uploaded
✔ Access permissions configured
✔ Access verified
✔ Documentation completed
🎉 Task-01 successfully completed!
